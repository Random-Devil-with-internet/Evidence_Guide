# Css
In week 2 I learned css. Css instead of being a markkup langauce is a stylesheet language that is used togather with html to add style and layout to a website.

## Syntax
In html you have elements eg. h1, p, img to add style to a sperific element you have to type the element as you would in html but with out the arrows outside it. Instead you put curly brackets after the element. Inside the curly brackets you put all the properties of the element. Properties can be color, width, font type, etc. and after each propertde you put a colon with the value ending with a semicolon.

Example:
```css
p {
  color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```
How you put css in a html file is by either using a external file or puting it in to the html file. To link an external css file you need to ues a link tage, inside the link tage there are three attributes href, rel, type
