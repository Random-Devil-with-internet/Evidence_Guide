# Html
Html is a markup language that is used to make the structure and the content of webpages. Styling in webpages is done through css instead of html. 

Html syntax uses tages to declare which type of element it is. An element being a component in the web page and to implement text in a element you put it between the tages.

Examples include:
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<h2>Sub-heading</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>
```


To begin making a webpage you need to add the html tag in the html tags you add the head and body tages. Inside the head tag you put the metadata about the webpage in.
