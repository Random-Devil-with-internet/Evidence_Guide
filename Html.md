# Html
In week 1 I learned about Html which is a markup language that is used to make the structure and the content of webpages. Styling in webpages is done through css instead of html. 

## Syntax
Html uses tags to declare which type of element it is. An element being a component in the web page and to implement text in an element you put it between the tags.

Examples include:
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<h2>Sub-heading</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>
```


To begin making a webpage you need to add the html tag in the html tags you add the head and body tags. Inside the head tag you put the metadata about the webpage in and the body tags is where you put the content and the structure of the webpage.

```html
<html>

<head>
<title>Title of the webpage</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Heading</h1>
<h2>Sub-heading</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>
</body>

</html>
```
## Images
Images in html are done by using the img tag inside the tag you put the attributes, the source of where the image is from ever using a file from your computer or a url for the internet. Alt text for the image to display in case the image does not load probably or for screen readers.

```html
<img src="Image.png" alt="Image">
```

## Reflection
Now that I have learned how to use html to make the structure of a website and how to add content eg. text and images. I have gained knowledge about how websites are made, edited and the behind the scenes of websites and this experience will come in handy in the making of assignment 1 for the website that I will have to build or if I need to build one in the future. Html is also useful to know before you start learning css and javascript for website development.

The ethical considerations in using web development are accessibility so that everybody can use the website featrues like alt text for screen readers and good colour contrast so that people with visual disabillities can see the website. Data and privacy security is an anthor important ethical consideration in web development asking for user consent and using the best data encryption will make your website trusted and law-abiding.
