# Html
Html is a markup language that is used to make the structure and the content of webpages. Styling is done through css instead of html. 

Html uses tages to declare which type of element it is. An element being a component in the web page and to implement text in a element you put it between the tages.

Examples include:
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<h2>Sub-heading</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>
```
