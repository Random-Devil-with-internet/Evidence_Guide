# Web Scraping
In week 7 I learned this time about web scraping which is gathering data using bots from the internet.

## BeautifulSoup
BeautifulSoup in a python package for extracting data from html and xml documents. It dose this by making the html document into a parse tree sorting it into a hierarchical order of the html document.

How you use BeautifulSoup is by first using another python package Requests that will get the HTTP request to the website of the URL then you add the HEADERS variable to make the bot look like that it is a valid browser overwise the website might reject the bot.
